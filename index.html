		<h2>Tekst najdraže pjesme</h2>
		<p>It starts with one thing<br>
		I don't know why<br>
		It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
		Keep that in mind<br>
		I designed this rhyme<br>
		To explain in due time<br>
		All I know<br>
		Time is a valuable thing<br>
		Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br>
		Watch it count down to the end of the day<br>
		The clock ticks life away</p>
		<p>It's so unreal<br>
		Didn't look out below<br>
		Watch the time go right out the window<br>
		Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know<br>
		Wasted it all just to watch you go<br>
		I kept everything inside<br>
		And even though I tried, it all fell apart<br>
		What it meant to me<br>
		Will eventually be a memory of a time when<br>
		<p>I tried so hard<br>
		And got so far<br>
		But in the end<br>
		It doesn't even matter<br>
		I had to fall<br>
		To lose it all<br>
		But in the end<br>
		It doesn't even matter</p>
		<p>One thing, I don't know why<br>
		It doesn't even matter how hard you try…</p>
